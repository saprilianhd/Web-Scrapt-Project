We were over the moon when we found out you will be performing in Kuala Lumpur. It was like a dream come true for the both us. My brother learnt to play piano just so he could play all the tunes of your songs and despite having all your songs on his phone, he still bought your CDs just so he could appreciate your music even more. Every time we hear your songs, it brings us back to a specific time in our memory (Orphans being played on a small skating rink in Fukuoka, Japan that we visited and singing along to Viva La Vida in our father's old truck, reciting the beautiful words of Every Teardrop is a Waterfall in our hometown room).Our hearts broke when we failed to get the tickets to the one concert that we would ever want to listen to in our lifetime (on both days) despite following all the steps and entering as early as we can despite constant system collapses and a poor queue system by Go Live Asia that allowed people who entered the queue later to jump ahead of us and there were a myriad of scalpers (resellers) who managed to secure dozens of tickets to resell at sky high prizes on Carousel that we can't afford. We implore you to listen to our plead and look into this matter. Listening to your live music even from afar would be like heaven to us. We are pleading for a second day but this time with better queue management (deter scalpers and prevent queue jumping-first come first served, constant server crashes). We sincerely hope you would take our pleas into consideration\n",

Even tix are now sold in ecommerce. While actual fans fighting to get the tix & can not get it. Perhaps next time, better less tix qty per buyer, so more opportunity for real fans, though means for promotor : not sold that fast & more qty of trx administration needed... 🙏💙💛💜\n",

A lot of fans (and not just from Malaysia, but from Singapore like myself) have been queueing up online for hours and abiding ticketing rules, only to be denied of tickets to both concerts due to scalpers gaming the system and Stubhub (they aren't the exclusive seller for KL) mass buying tickets from the authorised seller. What makes it more disgusting is the scalpers and Stubhub are reselling these ticket at exorbitant prices. It's really unfair to genuine Coldplay fans like us, especially those who may have saved up for the concert only to be denied of a chance at it because of these people.\n",

      "924. @coldplay Dear coldplay, I am not sure if you will see this message but I would just like to give it a try. My brother and I are your Malaysian fans. We were over the moon when we found out you will be performing in Kuala Lumpur. It was like a dream come true for the both us. My brother learnt to play piano just so he could play all the tunes of your songs and despite having all your songs on his phone, he still bought your CDs just so he could appreciate your music even more. Every time we hear your songs, it brings us back to a specific time in our memory (Orphans being played on a small skating rink in Fukuoka, Japan that we visited and singing along to Viva La Vida in our father's old truck, reciting the beautiful words of Every Teardrop is a Waterfall in our hometown room).Our hearts broke when we failed to get the tickets to the one concert that we would ever want to listen to in our lifetime (on both days) despite following all the steps and entering as early as we can despite constant system collapses and a poor queue system by Go Live Asia that allowed people who entered the queue later to jump ahead of us and there were a myriad of scalpers (resellers) who managed to secure dozens of tickets to resell at sky high prizes on Carousel that we can't afford. We implore you to listen to our plead and look into this matter. Listening to your live music even from afar would be like heaven to us. We are pleading for a second day but this time with better queue management (deter scalpers and prevent queue jumping-first come first served, constant server crashes). We sincerely hope you would take our pleas into consideration\n",
